# List of Spyderisk contributors

"Contributors" refers to individual people whose work appears in this
Kraken source code directory. There are two kinds of individual contributors:

1. Those listed in the [LICENSORS file](./LICENSORS.md), because as owners
they have the right to license their work as open source. Individuals are
listed there alongside organisations including Yahoo!, Microsoft and the University of Southampton.
2. Those who are listed in this file, who have between them contributed many
thousands of lines of code, but who cannot be licensors because they do not own
the code they have contributed because their employer owns the code instead.

If you feel you should be listed here but are not,
then please [do get in touch](mailto://team@spyderisk.org).
