# Short summary

Kraken, like its parent project [Spyderisk](https://github.com/Spyderisk), is
licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

The [README in the licenses directory](./LICENSES/README.md) explains *how* developers should apply
license headers to files in Kraken. This document is about the *why and what* of licensing.

The site [TL;DR Legal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2-0-apache-2-0)
summarises the Apache license as:
> You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices.
> This permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

For most people most of the time, this is all you need to know - please use and enjoy Kraken!

# Kraken Copyright and Licenses

Kraken source code is available entirely under [Open
Source](https://opensource.org/osd) licenses, especially the [Apache2
license](licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) as described above.

We use the [SPDX software component descriptors](https://spdx.dev/) for headers in
most files in Kraken. This a common open source Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) system.

# Licensor or Contributor?

The distinction matters legally, but in the day-to-day we just want to
acknowledge the people doing the work. The initial Kraken contributors
committed their work but do not own their contributions, and
therefore they cannot be licensors.

Kraken documentation is under a Creative Commons license, again
explained in detail in ```licenses/README.md```.

# No CLA

As a matter of policy, no Spyderisk project such as Kraken has a Contributor License Agreement (CLA),
for reaons similar to [Red Hat](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems),
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jun/09/do-not-need-cla/) and
other leading open source voices. 

Spyderisk adheres to the "inbound = outbound" principle, where Licensors get
exactly the same rights as anyone else in the world. While we use the excellent
Apache 2 license from [apache.org](https://apache.org), Spyderisk is not
affiliated with apache.org, and we do not use the Apache CLAs or other tools
which do not share rights equally with all.
